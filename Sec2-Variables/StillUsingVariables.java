/**
 * Still Using Variables
 * http://programmingbydoing.com/a/still-using-variables.html
 * Write a program that stores your name and year of graduation into variables, and displays their values on the screen.
 * Make sure that you use two variables, and that the variable that holds your name is the best type for such a
 * variable, and that the variable that holds the year is the best type for that variable.
 * Also make sure that your variable names are good: the name of a variable should always relate to its contents.
